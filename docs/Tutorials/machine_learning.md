# Overview
Once the data is imported, you can launch the setup process where you can choose all the different components of the active learning framework through a contextual menu which will adapt itself according to the data type and the task chosen during the data import.

The first choice is the learner, the model which will be trained.

ALAMBIC is currently able to support any kind of [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) model. However, not all of them are currently implemented.

<p><p class='label label-yellow'>Coming soon</p> Deep learning models will be implemented in a later version.</p>

You can find for each task the implemented models and link to their documentation. Most of the parameters related to the model are available for customization during the setup process.
